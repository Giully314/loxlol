# Exercise 2
Adding an instruction add complexity to the code because we need to add functions that recognize the new instruction (for execution, debug and so on). In our case, because we are using 8 bit for op codes and so supporting 256 instructions, our number of instructions is limited so we need to be careful. In this case the instruction is really simple so there aren't big flaws.
