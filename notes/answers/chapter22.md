# Exercise 1
We could use an hash table. I don't think it's worth the additional complexity because the work is done in the compiler and the number of variables is small.  

# Exercise 2
In python is not valid (undefined variable error) but in c++ it is valid but undefinied behavior.
I like approach in lox to report error at compile time of this type of things.
